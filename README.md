## 🐻 What is Bearx402?

Bearx402 is an open, permissionless network designed for:
- **Composable AI workflows**
- **Decentralized execution**
- **On-chain incentives for useful computation**

Builders deploy workflows.  
The network executes them.  
The best ones get used — and paid.

## ⚙️ Core Concepts

### Workflows
Composable pipelines of AI agents, tools, and logic that perform real tasks.

### Decentralized Compute
Execution is distributed across the network, removing reliance on centralized infrastructure.

### Incentives
Useful workflows earn rewards based on usage, performance, and adoption.

### Discovery Layer
The system surfaces what actually works — not what’s hyped.
